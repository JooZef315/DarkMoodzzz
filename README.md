## CS50x Final project

## projectâ€™s title: 
#### DarkMoodzzz


## Description: 
I made a Chrome extension using JavaScript that puts 
sites into dark mood,
the extension comes with a pop up with two options, 
(dark) button that allows users to apply the dark mood 
to the active tab,
and (normal) button the sets the site back to its normal theme.

works so well with sites like:
* github
* google drive and youtube
* stackoverflow
* W3school
* MDN
* reddit
* udacity and edx.org
* twitter
* facebook
* wikipedia and wikihow
* imdb and rottentomatoes
###### and so many other sites!
